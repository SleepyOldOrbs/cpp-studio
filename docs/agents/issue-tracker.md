# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use `--body-file` for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, also fetching its labels.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>`.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`, then keep only `authorAssociation` values of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE`.
- **Comment, label, or close**: use `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit --add-label`/`--remove-label`, or `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either. Resolve it with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog body. Create it with `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue. Where sub-issues are unavailable, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels are `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`). Once claimed, assign the ticket to the driving developer.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub's native issue dependencies. Where dependencies are unavailable, put `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, drop any with an open blocker or assignee, and take the first remaining ticket in map order.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`—the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the ticket, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
